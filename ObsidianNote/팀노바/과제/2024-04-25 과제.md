I need to create a function by implementing  a handler.
I don't think there is any way to create a functino that is separate from the user input that comes to mind. One thing that came to mind is that the paths of favorites contating '/' are displayed it would be nice to display the names and paths in turn at certain intervals.
Then, first I need to be able to apply the relevant functions to the recyclerview adapter.

There some problem but
I made finally filename and path switcher and it's pretty well

Tomorrow I will make calendar
Make calendar date system use file metadata 

And also I will make graph use handler I think I can do that

Today I make calendar function It's very simpler then before when I thought first but It's pretty well.
In this week I have to keep thinking "This is job and I have to do this like expert". Do not think What's fun.

Tomorrow, I will make graph, So I have to do first planning. Like I metioned upside I will use handler(thread) in drawing graph or moving graph.

It's good at me to concentrate on my work by lookin at a mount of work compared to recent work hours.
